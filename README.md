# Raschka build-LLM learning journey

This repository contains my learning notes and code while following Sebastian Raschka's "Build Large Language Models" material. The goal is to extract runnable, well-tested components from the notebooks and experiment with small transformers.

Structure highlights:

- `src/` — production-style, importable code
- `notebooks/` — exploratory notebooks tied to chapters
- `experiments/` — per-experiment configs and results
- `data/` — small sample data (large data kept out of Git)
- `tests/` — unit tests for core components

See `docs/` for learning notes and checkpoints.
